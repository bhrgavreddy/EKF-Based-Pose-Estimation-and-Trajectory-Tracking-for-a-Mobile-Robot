# EKF-Based Robot Pose Estimation and Trajectory Tracking in ROS

This project implements an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** for 2D robot pose estimation using trilateration and supports **waypoint-based trajectory tracking** in a simulated ROS environment. It integrates sensor fusion, control logic, and visualization tools to evaluate localization and tracking accuracy.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ 2D Pose Estimation using EKF with trilateration
- 🎯 Waypoint-Based Trajectory Tracking with control logic
- 📉 Tracking Error Consistently Under 6 cm
- 🔁 Real-Time Integration with ROS & Simulation
- 📊 Visualization with ROS Plots and RViz
